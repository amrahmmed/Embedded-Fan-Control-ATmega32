# Embedded-Fan-Control-ATmega32
This project implements an intelligent fan control system using the ATmega32 microcontroller. The system reads  ambient temperature via an LM35 sensor and adjusts the speed of a DC fan using PWM based on the measured  temperature. A push button toggles the motor operation via an external interrupt.
